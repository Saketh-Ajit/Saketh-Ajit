		Hello, I'm a backend developer, with experience in
		large scale distributed systems and data-intensive platforms.
		
		I am passionate about designing highly performant, low latency software.
	
	With my strong foundation in computer science and over fours years of professional experience, I bring expertise in developing distributed solutions and scalable backend systems.

	At PayPal, as a member of the Genesis Orchestration team, I developed sophisticated tools for analyzing latency across Kubernetes and Mesos clusters, enabling data-driven identification of platform bottlenecks. I worked on distributed caching for faster deployment and reduced load, contributing to the stability and efficiency of the company's centralized deployment platform.

	During my tenure at BlueOptima, I played a key role in developing a comprehensive developer analytics platform. This platform processed and analyzed complex code metrics to evaluate solution correctness, maintainability, and efficiency. I also engineered a custom backend ATS integration that significantly improved operational efficiency, resulting in \$10,000 annual cost savings. Additionally, I developed a Python-based security analysis tool that automated the detection of CVE-affected dependencies, saving 16 developer hours weekly across four departments.

	My research experience in medical image analysis,involved leveraging image detection to classify the risk of patients likely to suffer from cardio myopathy based on the thickness of the mycardium, combining computational analysis with healthcare applications. This project demonstrated my ability to apply analytical techniques to solve real-world problems.

	I am particularly interested in opportunities that combine:
	<ul class="About-interests">
	<li class="About-interest-points">Backend architecture design and implementation</li>
	<li class="About-interest-points">Performance optimization and scalability improvements</li>
	<li class="About-interest-points">Complex data processing and analytical systems development</li>
	<li class="About-interest-points">Integration of computational analysis with practical applications</li>
	</ul>

	 I am well-equipped to contribute to challenging technical projects. My background in computer science provides me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills essential for complex computational tasks.

	I would welcome the opportunity to work with your team.

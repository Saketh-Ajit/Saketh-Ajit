		Hello, I'm a backend developer, with experience in
		large scale distributed systems and data-intensive platforms.
		
		I am passionate about designing highly performant, low latency software.
	
	With my strong foundation in computer science and over fours years of professional experience, I bring expertise in developing data-driven solutions and scalable backend systems.

	At PayPal, I have demonstrated my capabilities in both platform development and data analytics. As a member of the Orchestration team, I developed sophisticated tools for analyzing container metrics across Kubernetes and Mesos clusters, enabling data-driven identification of platform bottlenecks. I worked on frameworks to perform orchestration on deployment pools and performed data analytics on metrics using Datadog and SignalFX, contributing to the stability and efficiency of the company's centralized deployment platform.

	During my tenure at BlueOptima, I played a key role in developing a comprehensive developer analytics platform. This platform processed and analyzed complex code metrics to evaluate solution correctness, maintainability, and efficiency. I also engineered a custom backend ATS integration that significantly improved operational efficiency, resulting in \$10,000 annual cost savings. Additionally, I developed a Python-based security analysis tool that automated the detection of CVE-affected dependencies, saving 16 developer hours weekly across four departments.

	My research experience includes designing a medical imaging tool using OpenCV for myocardium thickness measurement, combining computational analysis with healthcare applications. This project demonstrated my ability to apply analytical techniques to solve real-world problems, particularly in processing and analyzing complex medical DICOM images.

	I am particularly interested in opportunities that combine:
	    Backend architecture design and implementation
	    Performance optimization and scalability improvements
	    Complex data processing and analytical systems development
	    Integration of computational analysis with practical applications

	 I am well-equipped to contribute to challenging technical projects. My background in computer science provides me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills essential for complex computational tasks.

	I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background in computational analysis, data processing, and backend development could benefit your team.
